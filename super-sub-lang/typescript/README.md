# TypeScript

It seems more like a syntactic sugar to JavaScript & includes all the features specified in EcmaScript \(2015\). It compiles into plain Javascript complaint with ECMAScript 3, 5 etc as well.

### Features

* Scalability & Maintainability 
* Dynamically-loadable modules
* Interface / Classes/ Modules
* Static checking
* Symbol-based navigation, 
* Statement completion
* Code re-factoring.
